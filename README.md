# Accessibility Challenge - Horiseon Website Code Refactor

## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor the Horiseon websites' code to increase its accessibility, I wanted to provide a more semantic base to the HTML to give a more structured code. I fixed some of the broken links, and removed a lot of DIV elements replacing them with semantic elements. The biggest challenge I came across is making this website more user friendly across all media sizes. I learnt to group CSS classes, and helped create an efficient and condensed communication between both the CSS and HTML files. 

## Installation
